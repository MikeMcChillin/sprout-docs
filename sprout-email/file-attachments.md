You can enable Notification emails to attach files. 

![Enable File Attachments in Email]({asset:1267:url})

For example, if you submit a Form and the Form Entry has an Assets field for a resume, the resume file will get attached to the notification email. If you trigger a notification for when an Entry is saved and the Entry Form has an Assets field for a contest submission, the image file for the contest will be attached to the notification email.

Right now, notification attachments may not be a great fit for every website.  We will be adding better control over attachments in future releases and remove the need to enable this feature via a hidden config once we have made it more accessible via the Control Panel.
