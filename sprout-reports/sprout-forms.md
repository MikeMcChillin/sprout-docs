_Note: The Sprout Forms Entries Report will become available in Craft 3 when when we release Sprout Forms for Craft 3. It will be integrated into Sprout Forms so you will be able to use it without ever installing Sprout Reports, or install Sprout Reports to continue to manage all of your reports in once place._

Sprout Forms includes an Entries Report integration to query your form entries by date range using Sprout Reports.

Download Sprout Forms alongside Sprout Reports and create a new report from the Reports tab in Sprout Reports.
