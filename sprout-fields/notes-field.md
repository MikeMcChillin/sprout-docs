# Overview

The Notes Field is an information-only field for Craft CMS that allows you to add supplementary information to your fields with five different custom styles.  This may be useful to integrate enhanced documentation into your sections, or just annoy people with unnecessary colors (use wisely!).

## Craft 3

The Notes field comes with a Default Matrix-style field. You can add additional styles by adding your own field styles in the `config/sproutnotes` folder.
