# Using Sprout Forms with Sprout Reports

Sprout Forms specializes in managing forms and integrates with Sprout Reports to allow you to view and export your Form data in other formats.

You can export a CSV of your Sprout Forms Entries by creating a new Report from the _Sprout Forms Entries_ Data Source in Sprout Reports. The `Sprout Forms Entries` Data Source allows you to export data for a specific form and date range.
