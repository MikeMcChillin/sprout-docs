Support is available for Sprout Email license holders.

**Documentation**<br>
Our goal is to make the documentation the primary place that you can get your answers. Please review the docs for an understanding of the plugin and examples.  If the docs haven't answered your question, let us know by clicking on the **support icon in the lower right**, or you can fall back on the following options:

**Craft Stack Exchange**<br>
We monitor [Craft Stack Exchange](https://craftcms.stackexchange.com/): for posts tagged `plugin-sproutforms`, `plugin-sproutemail`, and `plugin-sproutseo`.

**Email**<br>
For bugs or general support that doesn't fall in another category, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:sprout@barrelstrengthdesign.com" target="_blank">sprout@barrelstrengthdesign.com</a>

**We don't regularly monitor Craft Slack or Twitter or Google+**<br>
While members of our team are in the Craft Community on Slack, Twitter, and Google+, those places are not the best for support.  We monitor those channels less frequently and, when we do get contacted in those locations, will probably just tell you to drop us a note via the help widget or email to get you into our primary support workflow.
