# Feature Requests

View and upvote existing Feature Requests or add your own on the public Github repo for each plugin. Feature Requests are considered on a case by case basis and we don't make any promises as to when a new feature will be added to one of our plugins. 

::: tip
If you need a planned feature that we have not yet added, consider hiring us. We are available for custom development and consulting services and are happy to improve or extend our plugins based on your project needs.
