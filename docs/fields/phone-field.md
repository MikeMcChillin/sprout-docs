# Phone Field

The Phone Field Type helps you manage valid international phone numbers with a custom Phone Field.

When a phone number is recognized, a _Phone_ icon appears at the right hand side of the phone field.  If you click on the _Phone_ link, your computer will open your primary phone program to initiate a call.

The Phone Field helps parse, format, and validate phone numbers for all countries and regions of the world.

## Settings

Phone Numbers are validated based on the country that is selected. Validation is powered by Google's international phone number library `libphonenumber`.

By default, the Phone Field is setup for international addresses from all countries but can be limited to a single country as well.
