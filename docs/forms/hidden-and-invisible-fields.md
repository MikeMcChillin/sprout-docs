A [Hidden Field]({entry:1039:url}) and [Invisible Field]({entry:1145:url}) can both be found in [Sprout Fields]({entry:1035:url}).

These two fields can help you manage a handful of front-end form use cases where you may need to capture a value that doesn't display or is not seen by your users. 

You can set each field to a specific value or, with the help of the `setFieldVariables` tag, the Hidden Field and the Invisible Field can be set to any value on your page.  A longer description of this functionality can be found in the [Hidden Field documentation]({entry:1039:url}#setting-a-dynamic-value).
