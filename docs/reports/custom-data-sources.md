# Data Sources

A Data Source defines a set of data that can be queried by a Report and which options can be used when querying that data. A Data Source can define data that exists in your Craft installation or from any source that you wish to query near or far. For example, a custom Data Source could query data from a third-party API and return the results to Sprout Reports to display.

Sprout Reports provides a few Data Sources out of the box:

- **Custom Query** - Create reports using custom SQL queries.
- **Users** - Create reports with User and User Group data
- **Category Usage by Section** - See the breakdown of how many Categories are in use by Entries
